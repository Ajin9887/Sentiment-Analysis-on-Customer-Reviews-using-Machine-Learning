# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Customer-Reviews-using-Machine-Learning
Problem Statement

The people cannot analyse exact information in the document and sentence level opinion mining on customer reviews. The proposed system aims to simplify and automate the task of identifying the various aspects being talked about a particular product in a review

Introduction

This project focuses on aspect-based sentiment analysis of customer reviews for Amazon Alexa, aiming to extract opinions on specific product features such as sound, battery, and quality. By analysing the sentiments expressed in the reviews, the project seeks to provide detailed insights into how customers perceive these aspects. The analysis uses a rule-based approach to classify sentiments as positive, neutral, or negative, providing valuable feedback for businesses to understand customer preferences and identify areas for improvement in their products.

Methodology

In this project, the methodology focuses on performing sentiment analysis using a combination of machine learning and aspect-based sentiment analysis techniques. The goal is to accurately classify customer reviews based on their sentiment and further analyse specific aspects of the reviews to gain deeper insights into customer opinions. The workflow involves several key steps, including data collection, preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation. The sentiment analysis will be conducted using a Random Forest model, a robust machine learning algorithm known for its ability to handle large datasets and prevent overfitting by building multiple decision trees. This will ensure that the sentiment classification is both accurate and scalable. Aspect-based sentiment analysis will be employed to break down the reviews into specific components (aspects) such as product quality, price, or customer service, providing more granular insights beyond overall sentiment.
